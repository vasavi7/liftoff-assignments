### Overview
This project is the St. Louis City Attractions App. This app will guide the visitors with available attractions in St. Louis City.

Have you ever been stuck on finding things to do in the city? The St. Louis City attractions app comes in handy in that you are able to find all the attractions in the city with the flexibility to find attractions according to your interests and location, as well as other factors. The app also interacts with other websites in order to provide the user with additional information including events, hours of operation, and location. This idea came about to provide ease in finding all the information you need to find attractions in the City.

Visiting tourist attractions and trying local food are among the main activities' tourists undertake when they visit a new city. Given that the number of attractions is typically large and that tourists are also restricted to time and/or money budgets, they need to optimize and sometimes compromise on the selection of relevant attractions. Therefore, St. Louis City Attractions app has been developed for assisting tourists in planning their trips.
